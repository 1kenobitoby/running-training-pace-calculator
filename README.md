# Running training pace calculator app
A web app that allows people enter either a known distance running race time or a known VDOT or VO<sub>2</sub>max and get a list of appropriate running training paces for different types of running training.

# Project description
This is a Streamlit web app written in Python 3.8.10. It allows people to calculate personal running training paces. It uses the methods published by running coach Jack Daniels widely available online and in his books including Daniels' Running Formula (2nd Ed., 2005). The benefit is that the app packages them up into one easy to use and readily available resource.<br>
The project has been built in Streamlit V1.27.0 and distributed as a public app on the Streamlit Community Cloud.<br>
There are no plans to develop or update the app (except for bug fixes). Users have the option to contact the authors to suggest changes or improvements. We might even get around to implementing some of them if they tip us.<br>
